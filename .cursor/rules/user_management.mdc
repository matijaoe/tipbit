## User Management

### Authentication
- OAuth via GitHub, Google, X, Twitch ([Nuxt auth utils](mdc:https:/nuxt.com/modules/auth-utils)).
- Future support: Passkey, Nostr login, 2FA (TOTP/security keys).

### Multi-Profile Support
- Users can manage multiple profiles per account, each with a unique public handle.
- Profiles have independent payment connections.
