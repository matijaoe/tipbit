## User Management

### Authentication
- OAuth via GitHub, Google, X, Twitch (@Nuxt Auth Utils).
- Future support: Passkey, Nostr login, 2FA (TOTP/security keys).

### Multi-Profile Support
- By default, a profile is created for the user when they sign up, with a default handle (e.g. `@user123`)
- Users can manage multiple profiles per account, each with a unique public handle
- Public handle can be changed at any time.
- Profiles share payment connections, but can have individual ordering preferences.
- Profile can have unique branding, public name, and avatar
