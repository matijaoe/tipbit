## Coding Standards

- Naming: camelCase for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, kebab-case for file names.
- Strict TypeScript types enforced.
- Always use `const` for variables. Do not use function declarations, always use arrow functions.
- Use `type` over `interface`.
- Use Vue composables when appropriate.
- Async/await over callbacks.
- Modular, SOLID principles for extensibility.
- Comment complex logic; ensure readability and maintainability.
