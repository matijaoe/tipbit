# Project Overview

Tipbit is a simple, privacy-focused Bitcoin tipping platform leveraging the Lightning Network. Users can effortlessly send and receive tips using multiple profiles under a single account, each with a unique handle and payment setup.

## Vision & Goals
- **Frictionless Bitcoin tipping** via Lightning Network (using Strike, Coinos, Alby APIs).
- **Multiple user profiles** per account, each with customizable payment methods.
- Privacy-first: anonymous tipping by default, optional profile-sharing.
- Modular architecture for easy integration of future features (on-chain Bitcoin, user-managed nodes, BOLT12 invoicing).

## Key User Flows
- **Tipping Flow:** User visits a profile (`/@handle`), selects tip amount (sats/USD/EUR), and pays via Lightning invoice (generated through external APIs like Strike, Coinos, or Alby). Immediate real-time confirmation provided.
- **Profile Management:** Authenticated users (OAuth via GitHub, Google, X, Twitch) create multiple profiles, connect Lightning payment services (Strike, Coinos, Alby), and manage payment method priority through drag-and-drop UI.

## Technical Stack & Deployment
- **Frontend:** Nuxt 3 (TypeScript, Vue Composition API), Tailwind CSS, shadcn-vue components.
- **Backend:** Nuxt server routes, Nitro API endpoints.
- **Database:** SQLite with Drizzle ORM (minimal data storage).
- **Authentication:** OAuth initially, future support for Passkeys/Nostr.
